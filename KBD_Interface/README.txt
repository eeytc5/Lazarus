This is a card that connects to one of the expansion ports on the motherboard. 
It interfaces the computer with the custom keyboard and two rotary encoders (X & Y).

Interacting with either the rotary encoders or the keyboard will trigger the same interrupt. 
It is up to the ISR to deduce which devices the interrupt orignated from.
